From Wikipedia:

An iwan (Persian: ایوان‎ eyvān, Arabic: إيوان‎ Iwan) is a rectangular hall or space, usually vaulted, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open. The formal gateway to the iwan is called pishtaq, a Persian term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs.
 

Why this research area?

Arabic language(Holy Quran language) has historic and geographic dimensions deserve to be proud of it, such human language stayed spoken with through 1400 years  without changes deserve all the care from us.

In this era, a lot of efforts emerged to process Arabic Language Automatically. However, they are still little and we need to enrich this research area.
From the other side, web technologies have lots of diversities, knowing that the new track in the computing field is Web Science. So, when we merge it with Arabic language processing field, certainly we will produce wealthy web applications.

We will not forget the Islamic applications field , which we have to put all our effort to serve our religion.

At the end, we can say that research investments in those fields will return all the benefits, not only to our university but to our religion and community.
